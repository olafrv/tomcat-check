=Overview=

*tomcat-check* is Linux perl script to monitor periodically [http://tomcat.apache.org/ Apache Tomcat] processes status through some custom checks, comparing border conditions against data generated by the Apache Tomcat built-in Manager, the [http://code.google.com/p/psi-probe/ psi-probe] improved manager Web Interfaces and others, taking if needed further actions, including to warn system administrators with local server syslog calls or e-mails.

The processes status of Apache Tomcat are checked using the builtin Apache Tomcat HTTP monitoring interface called [http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/manager-howto.html Manager].

Usually this interface output HTML but with the undocumented [http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/tc6.0.x/trunk/java/org/apache/catalina/manager/StatusManagerServlet.java but active in the code of StatusManagerServlet.java] functionality to output _well formed XML_ with the manager status data, *tomcat-check* parses this _XML_ to do its job. 

*tomcat-check* can be _complemented_ with the google code project *[http://code.google.com/p/psi-probe/ psi-probe]* an enhanced replacement for Apache Tomcat Manager.


Also you can see last *tomcat-check*  SVN trunk *[http://code.google.com/p/tomcat-check/source/browse/trunk/ source code]* licensed under GNU/GPL v3 or later license.
